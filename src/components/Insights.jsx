			<p className="mb-2">
				The Yearly Temperature Anomaly Distribution is important because not all areas of the Earth
				are warming equally, and not all areas respond the same to the warming. For example, the
				polar regions are warming faster than the global average, which accelerates the ice melt.
				Understanding regional temperature increases will be one of many crucial factors for our
				ability to deal with regional and global climate change disasters.
